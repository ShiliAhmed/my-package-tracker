# My Package Tracker - Telegram Bot

This repository contains a simple package tracker originally written as `AliExpress.py` and extended with a Telegram bot wrapper in `telegram_bot.py` so you can check package status from your phone.

## Quick start

1. Create a Telegram bot and get its token from BotFather.
2. Put the token in an environment variable named `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` or create a file named `telegram_token.txt` with the token as plaintext in the project root.
3. Install dependencies (preferably in a virtualenv):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1; pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the bot:

```powershell
python telegram_bot.py
```

## Commands

- `/start` - Start the bot and see interactive buttons
- `/checkall` - Check all packages from `package_list.json` (may take a while)
- `/check <TRACKING>` - Check one specific tracking number

## Features

- âœ… **Interactive buttons** - Quick actions without typing commands
- âœ… **Copyable tracking numbers** - Tap to copy any tracking number
- âœ… **Mobile-friendly output** - Optimized for phone screens
- âœ… **Auto-refresh** - Check packages again with one button press
- âœ… **Help system** - Built-in help with navigation

## Notes

- The bot calls the same scraping logic as `AliExpress.py`. Scraping may be rate-limited by the target site.
- Desktop version still works - original `fetch_package_updates` function preserved for computer use.
- Mobile version uses `create_mobile_output` for better phone readability.
